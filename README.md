This project was generated with
[Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The
application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can
also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the
`dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via
[Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To
use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end
testing capabilities.

### Considerations for a Highly Extensible and Modular Stepper:

1. **Dynamic Step Addition/Removal**: Allow steps to be dynamically added or removed during the stepper's lifecycle.
2. **Customizable Templates**: Provide template inputs for customizing the look and feel of each step, including headers, content, and navigation buttons.
3. **Validation Handling**: Each step can have its own validation rules, which must be passed before moving to the next step.
4. **Navigation Control**: Provide options to control the visibility and functionality of navigation buttons ('Next', 'Previous', 'Skip').
5. **Event Handling**: Emit events for step changes, completion, errors, and other significant actions for parent components to react accordingly.
6. **Data Sharing**: Allow steps to share data with each other, either via a shared service or direct communication (Input/Output).
7. **Lazy Loading**: Support for lazy loading steps to improve performance, especially for steps that involve loading data or complex UI components.
8. **Accessibility**: Ensure that the stepper is accessible, supporting keyboard navigation and screen readers.
9. **State Persistence**: Option to persist the state of the stepper (e.g., the current step) in a service or local storage to maintain state across sessions/pages.
